# Quick Weather

This is a web application for busy planners who want to check the weather quickly.

This was my first front end application that used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to make something that was simple enough, but also useful in my daily life. One of the things that I thought would be handy would be a weather app that gave me the information that I wanted it to give me. Thus, Quick Weather was born.
